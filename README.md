# Week 7: PacMen Exercise

## So, what am I looking at here?

### The assignment was to make a functioning button that creates a new PacMan, and another functioning button that starts all PacMen present on the screen moving. When "Make One" is pushed, the new PacMan image is positioned and added to the div called "game". It's then further added to the array of PacMen, which keeps track of the velocity and position of each one. PacMen are also supposed to bounce off whatever wall they hit.

## How to Run This Project

### You can run this by forking this repo to your own GitHub, and loading index.html in your browser. Click the Make One to create another PacMan, and Start Game to start them moving.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

### Right now, there are no improvements planned for this particular code, but I may consider eventualy adding in code that makes each PacMan change direction whenever it hits the wall.
